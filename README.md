# Philippine ICT Growth by Industry and Region 

## Overview / Description

This project explores the status of **Information and Communication Technology (ICT)** across different regions in the Philippines from 2010 to 2019. It analyzes key indicators to identify which regions were progressive or underutilized in terms of digital adoption and employment.

Key metrics include:

-**Employee and establishment growth**

-**Total employees and establishments per year**

-**Average employees per establishment**

-**Computer equipment vs. actual computer usage**

-**Regions with low internet access and establishments**

The data set was extracted from the [Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)](https://openstat.psa.gov.ph/PXWeb/pxweb/en/DB/DB__3F/0013F4BSIC0.px/?rxid=bdf9d8da-96f1-4100-ae09-18cb3eaeb313) website.


## Key Findings
Between **2010** and **2019**, the Philippine ICT sector saw a *21.51%* increase in employees and a *132.96%* increase in establishments.

-Employee growth was steady from **2010** to **2017**, but declined in **2019**.

-Establishment growth peaked from **2010–2013**, declined between **2013–2017**, and recovered by **2019**.

-Interestingly, from **2013** to **2017**, employee numbers rose while the number of establishments declined — suggesting consolidation or workforce concentration in fewer companies.

-Lastly, there is a notable gap between computer ownership and actual usage, indicating underutilization of digital resources across industries and regions.

-From year **2010 - 2017**, the number of employees saw a rise of *21.51%*
